1. 在华硕主机上不能正常使用：或许是通道的原因、或许是供电接口的原因

2. 在服务器上也出现以下报错：
```
1. This PCI I/O region assigned to your NVIDIA device is invalid
2. ERROR: Unable to load the kernel module 'nvidia.ko'.  This happens most frequently when this kernel module was built against the wrong or improperly configured kernel sources, with a version of gcc that differs from the one used to build the target kernel, or if another driver, such as nouveau, is present and prevents the NVIDIA kernel module from obtaining ownership of the NVIDIA device(s), or no NVIDIA device installed in this system is supported by this NVIDIA Linux graphics driver release.
```
- 尝试更换多个驱动版本，失效
- 尝试此[方案](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/nvrm-this-pci-i-o-region-assigned-to-your-nvidia-device-is-invalid/229899)未解决
- 在上一方案之后，尝试在 BIOS 中启用“Above 4G decoding”，成功安装。
